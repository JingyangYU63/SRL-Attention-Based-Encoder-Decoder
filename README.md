## What is SRL?

In natural language processing, semantic role labeling (SRL) is the process that assigns labels to words or phrases in a sentence that indicates their semantic role in the sentence, such as that of an agent, predicate, or patient.

Who did what to whom at when at where?
[Agent] [Predicate] [Patient] [Time] [Location]
I wrote this slide this afternoon in Cornell CIS lounge.

## Why SRL? Semantic Understanding!

Performing SRL Task = Semantic Understanding

Semantic understanding is cornerstone of:
- machine translation
- information extraction
- text summarization
- question answering

## PropBank Frames scheme

- Arg0: Agent
- Arg1: Patient
- Arg2: Instrument, benefactive, attribute
- ArgM-LOC: Locative modifiers indicate where some action takes place. 
- ArgM-TMP: Temporal ArgMs show when an action took place, such as "in 1987", "last Wednesday","soon" or "immediately". 

The notion of a locative is not restricted to physical locations, but abstract locations are being marked as LOC as well , like "[in his speech]-LOC he was talking about â€¦" Also included in the time notion are adverbs of frequency (eg. often always, sometimes), adverbs of duration (for a year/in an year), order (eg. first), and repetition (eg. again).
