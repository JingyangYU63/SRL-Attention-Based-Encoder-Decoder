## What is SRL?

In natural language processing, semantic role labeling (SRL) is the process that assigns labels to words or phrases in a sentence that indicates their semantic role in the sentence, such as that of an agent, predicate, or patient.

Who did what to whom at when at where?
[Agent] [Predicate] [Patient] [Time] [Location]
I wrote this slide this afternoon in Cornell CIS lounge.

## Why SRL? Semantic Understanding!

Performing SRL Task = Semantic Understanding

Semantic understanding is cornerstone of:
- machine translation
- information extraction
- text summarization
- question answering
